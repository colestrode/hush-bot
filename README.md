# hush-bot
A Slack bot that (nicely) reminds people not to use @here, @channel, @group, or @everyone.

## Setup

Set a `SLACK_API_TOKEN` env var to connect hush-bot to your Slack team and invite it to a channel and :tada:
before you know it you will be enjoying a good night's sleep free of needless Slack notifications!
